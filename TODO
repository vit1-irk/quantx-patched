- Transition to Qt 4.6.3
- Report version information (about dialog)
- Dialog for wave packet should be better
- Avoid wave functions flickers in compute_PsixE and others
+ User interrupts computation

- bug: add segments, then 1-well, goto table -> segv
- table: add insert rows and possibilities Of editing 
- tableU: want to *edit* shown width/U, not re-type
- need maximize button on plotters
- more precision in tableEn
- single barrier is junk in PotentialScene
